# Special Pancake

This lightweight canvas runner lives entirely in the repository root and can be opened in a browser with `npm start` if you already have dependencies installed locally. Gameplay logic and styling are plain JavaScript and CSS—no bundler or build step is required.

Controls: A/Left and D/Right steer the ball, Space/Up jumps with buffered coyote time, **Sound on/off** toggles audio cues, and **Reset** restarts the run with your selected ball.

## GitHub remote
The `origin` remote points to `https://github.com/4n7h0ny/special-pancake.git`. If you added it with a personal access token (PAT), you can push without further prompts. For a cleaner config, swap the remote URL to the plain HTTPS form once your credential helper is set up:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/4n7h0ny/special-pancake.git
```

## Pushing
Work happens on the `main` branch. To publish commits:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

After the first push, use `git push` to update GitHub.
